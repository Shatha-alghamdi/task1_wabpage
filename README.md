Introduction

#In this project, I have built a web page for a control board to manage the directions of a robot, with the data connected to a databas

Requirements:
- I used the Visual Studio code editor.
- For the database, I used AXMPP.

To begin, I downloaded the AXAPP program, which is a server that allows us to build a database.

I created a database and named it "Web". After building the database, I started configuring the table in which I will store the web page data. In the table, I needed to create 2 columns - the first one for the user, and the second one to store and display the web page data.

After building the database table, it became ready to receive the web page data.

Then, I built the web page, which contains 5 buttons:
The first button is named "right",
The second button is named "left",
The third button is named "forward",
The fourth button is named "backward",
And the fifth button is named "stop".

After building the page, I connected it through the code to the database that was designed to receive the data. Finally, I now have a web page that is connected to the database.
